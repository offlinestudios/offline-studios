# V6.12 Release Notes - Mobile Badge Overlap Fix

**Release Date:** November 3, 2025  
**Version:** 6.12  
**Priority:** Critical Bug Fix

## Issue Fixed

**Mobile Badge Collision:** On mobile devices (375px-390px width), the "Hair Salons" and "Law Firms" badge text appeared overlapping in the same badge position, making them unreadable.

## Root Cause

The V6.11 hotfix attempted to fix badge spacing, but the underlying issue was in the **main styles.css** file:

```css
/* OLD - BROKEN */
.badge-tl { top: 6%; }   /* Dentists */
.badge-tr { top: 6%; }   /* Law Firms - SAME VERTICAL POSITION! */
.badge-bl { bottom: 14%; }  /* Hair Salons */
```

Both `badge-tl` and `badge-tr` were positioned at **top: 6%**, meaning they appeared at the same vertical level. On narrow mobile screens, this caused them to visually overlap or appear stacked.

## Solution

Updated `css/hotfix-hero-badges.css` with **distinct vertical positions** for each badge:

```css
/* NEW - FIXED */
.badge-tl { 
  top: 8% !important;     /* Dentists - top left */
}

.badge-tr { 
  top: 28% !important;    /* Law Firms - MOVED DOWN significantly */
  right: 6% !important;
}

.badge-bl { 
  bottom: 8% !important;  /* Hair Salons - bottom left */
  left: 6% !important;
}
```

### Key Changes:

1. **Law Firms badge moved down** from `top: 6%` to `top: 28%` - creating **20% vertical separation** from Dentists badge
2. **Increased hero height** to `600px` (from 580px) for more vertical breathing room
3. **Reduced badge size** to `64px` (from 68px) for tighter footprint
4. **All positions use `!important`** to override conflicting rules in main CSS

## Visual Result

**Before V6.12:**
- Dentists badge: top 6%
- Law Firms badge: top 6% ← **OVERLAP!**
- Hair Salons badge: bottom 8%

**After V6.12:**
- Dentists badge: top 8%
- Law Firms badge: top 28% ← **Clear separation**
- Hair Salons badge: bottom 8%

## Testing

- Mobile viewport (375px - iPhone SE): ✓ Badges properly spaced
- Mobile viewport (390px - iPhone 12): ✓ Badges properly spaced

## Files Changed

## Deployment Instructions
