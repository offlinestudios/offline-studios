# V6.13 Release Notes - Law Firms Badge Visibility Fix

**Release Date:** November 3, 2025  
**Version:** 6.13  
**Priority:** Critical Bug Fix

## Issue Fixed

**Law Firms Badge Invisible:** After V6.12 deployment, the Law Firms badge was completely invisible on mobile devices. User screenshot showed only 2 badges visible (Hair Salons and Dentists), with the Law Firms badge missing entirely.

## Root Cause

V6.12 attempted to fix badge overlap by moving the Law Firms badge to `top: 28%`. However, this positioned the badge **too far down** on mobile screens, causing it to either:

1. Be positioned off-screen or outside the visible viewport
2. Be hidden behind the +112% card due to z-index stacking
3. Appear in an unexpected location that made it effectively invisible

## Solution

Updated `css/hotfix-hero-badges.css` with **better vertical positioning** for all badges:

```css
/* V6.13 - FIXED */
.badge-tl { 
  top: 10% !important;     /* Dentists - moved up from 8% */
  left: 8% !important; 
}

.badge-tr { 
  top: 15% !important;     /* Law Firms - moved up from 28% */
  right: 8% !important; 
}

.badge-bl { 
  bottom: 10% !important;  /* Hair Salons - adjusted from 8% */
  left: 8% !important; 
}

/* Added z-index to ensure badges are above card */
.stat-badge {
  z-index: 30 !important;  /* Above card's z-index: 20 */
}

.stat-card.stat-card-main {
  z-index: 20 !important;  /* Below badges */
}
```

### Key Changes:

1. **Law Firms badge** moved from `top: 28%` to `top: 15%` - now visible in top-right area
2. **Dentists badge** moved from `top: 8%` to `top: 10%` - better spacing
3. **Hair Salons badge** adjusted to `bottom: 10%` - consistent margins
4. **Z-index hierarchy** added - badges (z-index: 30) above card (z-index: 20)
5. **Horizontal margins** increased to 8% for better edge clearance

## Visual Result

**Before V6.13 (V6.12):**
- Dentists badge: top 8%, left 6% ✓ visible
- Law Firms badge: top 28%, right 6% ✗ **INVISIBLE**
- Hair Salons badge: bottom 8%, left 6% ✓ visible

**After V6.13:**
- Dentists badge: top 10%, left 8% ✓ **VISIBLE**
- Law Firms badge: top 15%, right 8% ✓ **VISIBLE**
- Hair Salons badge: bottom 10%, left 8% ✓ **VISIBLE**

## Testing

Tested on:
- Desktop viewport (1279px): ✓ All 3 badges visible and properly spaced
- Mobile test page: ✓ All 3 badges confirmed visible with debug info
- Badge positions verified with computed styles
- Z-index stacking confirmed correct

## Files Changed

- `css/hotfix-hero-badges.css` - Updated badge positions and z-index
- `todo.md` - Marked V6.13 as complete
- `mobile-test-v6.13.html` - Created debug test page (dev only)

## Deployment Instructions

1. **Clear browser cache** on mobile devices before testing (critical!)
2. Navigate to: `https://offlinestudios.github.io/offline-studios/`
3. Verify all three badges are visible:
   - Dentists (top-left)
   - Law Firms (top-right)
   - Hair Salons (bottom-left)
4. If Law Firms badge still not visible, add `?v=6.13` to URL to force cache bypass
